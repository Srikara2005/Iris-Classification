**Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning**

This project is a hands-on machine learning application that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements. Using simple features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the model learns how to distinguish between different types of iris flowers.

The project is built using the Iris Dataset, a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning, first introduced by Ronald Fisher. It contains 150 flower samples belonging to three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Through this project, I explore the complete machine learning workflow—from loading and understanding the data, to training classification models, evaluating their performance, and finally making predictions on new inputs. This makes the project a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the basics of supervised learning and classification.
